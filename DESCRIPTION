Description: This package provides functionality to run a number of tasks in the 
    differential expression analysis workflow. This encompasses the most widely 
    used steps, from running various enrichment analysis tools with a unified interface
    to creating plots and beautifying table components linking to external websites
    and databases. This streamlines the generation of comprehensive analysis reports.
